<p>In order to open a bank account, you will need to present a valid identification. You will also need to make a minimum deposit of $5. It is common to open both a checking and savings account at the same time.</p>
<p>There are many banks to choose from, but the following two banks are convenient for Purdue students:</p>

<p>A checking account allows you to use personal checks. Although it is possible to pay bills online in the United States, there are still some bills that need to be paid by personal check. It is convenient to purchase checks immediately when you open your account, but checks purchased from banks can be expensive. It is therefore economical to order a small amount of checks from the bank for immediate use, and order more checks from other places at a lower price later. You can also get a debit card immediately. Checking accounts typically do not earn interest or earn very little interest.</p>
<p>A savings account is a type of deposit account, and it is convenient because you can transfer money to your checking account at any time. The interest rate is still low, but it is higher than that of a checking account. It is common to keep only about one month&#39;s living expenses in your checking account, and to keep the rest in your savings account.</p>
<p>There is a monthly fee for opening an account at a bank. If you receive RA or TA from Purdue, you can set up your salary to be automatically deposited into your checking account each month. In this case, many banks will waive the fee.</p>
<p>It is possible to check your bank balance, transfer money between accounts, and so on using online banking. When you open an account, you will be able to create an ID and password for online banking if you tell the teller that you want to use online banking. You can use online banking directly from your computer or phone without installing a digital certificate or program. You can also pay bills online using online banking.</p>
