Continuing, full-time students who have paid the student fee are eligible for routine office visits at no charge from the week of Boiler Gold Rush through graduation. All other eligible students and spouses or domestic partners are eligible to be seen, but will be charged for office visits. All other medical services do have charges associated with them. This includes, but is not limited to, services such as physical exams, office procedures, medication administration, laboratory tests, x-rays, and physical therapy. Please ask if you have questions about the cost of services. PUSH is in network for most United Healthcare and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield plans. We will also bill any insurance you present. It is always best to call your insurance company prior to your visit to verify your coverage and benefits. </span></p><p><strong><span>Medical Services</span></strong>
<span>Provides primary care for both acute and chronic medical conditions by appointment. Medical Clinic providers are both physicians and nurse practitioners and you are encouraged to see the same provider whenever you need care. Get to know our providers on our </span><a href='https://www.purdue.edu/push/_internal/_archive/index.html'><span>provider biography page</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><strong><span>Covid-19 Management</span></strong><span> </span>
<span>In light of the Covid-19 situation, Purdue has made changes in its management approach. We no longer require students to report their positive Covid test to PUSH. Instead, if you test positive using an at-home COVID-19 test, you should execute your personal isolation plan and avoid contact with others as much as possible. If you must be around others, wear a face mask. You can calculate your isolation period using the </span><a href='https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/isolation.html'><span>CDC isolation calculator</span></a><span>. If you need assistance managing your symptoms or scheduling a test, please schedule an appointment through the patient portal or call 765-494-1700. </span></p><p><strong><span>Prescription Management of ADD/ADHD</span></strong>
<span>Patients may be evaluated for a potential or existing diagnosis of ADD/ADHD. There are several options for medication treatment for ADHD. </span><strong><span>PUSH physicians and Nurse Practitioners prescribe non-stimulant medications</span></strong><span>. This policy is designed to promote student safety, since stimulant medications are controlled substances with a risk of abuse and dependence and can have serious adverse effects if combined with substances of abuse. For more information about ADD/ADHD please click </span><a href='https://www.purdue.edu/push/medical/adhd-treatment-info-page.html'><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><strong><span>Infusion Services</span></strong>
<span>As part of our efforts to meet student needs, PUSH offers on-campus infusion treatment services for both chronic and acute medical conditions. Our team of skilled nurses will work directly with your infusion prescribing provider (in or out of state) to ensure that your treatment plan is not interrupted with the transition to college living. Contact us today (765-494-1700 or </span><a href='mailto:shc@purdue.edu'><span>shc@purdue.edu</span></a><span>) to find out how we can help you get started on the process. The PUSH nursing team will determine if your infusion is appropriate for PUSH to provide in our facility; provide the patient and/or family member with PUSH contacts to discuss billing and insurance; reach out to the ordering provider to obtain the infusion order and medication, and arrange for the first infusion appointment. We know that infusions may disrupt your life. PUSH is able to minimize that disruption for most students and we look forward to providing that service for you if needed.</span></p><p><strong><span>Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health Services</span></strong>
