<h3 id='drivers-license'>Driver&#39;s License</h3>
<p>To get a driver&#39;s license, you must visit the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) and take a written and driving test. The closest DMV to Purdue is in Lafayette. (There used to be one in West Lafayette, but it&#39;s gone. Yikes.)</p>
<p>DMV Lafayette Branch
2200 Elmwood Ave Suite A6, Lafayette, IN 47904 </p>
<p>You will need the following documents to apply for a driver&#39;s license. Unlike in Korea, you don&#39;t need to bring your photo with you - the BMV will take it for you when they issue your driver&#39;s license. (Be prepared to come out looking almost like a wanted man.) </p>
<ul>
<li>Passport + Visa</li>
<li>Entry document (I-94)</li>
<li>2 documents to prove your address, such as a utility bill or bank statement</li>
<li>SSN card (can be replaced with a paycheck stub)</li>

</ul>
<p>You don&#39;t need an appointment at the BMV, just show up, pull your license plate, and wait. You can take the written test the same day you show up, but you&#39;ll usually have to wait 1-2 weeks for the driving test. To prepare for the written test, you can use the Driver&#39;s Manual provided by the BMV, and you&#39;ll need to get at least 28 out of 34 questions correct to pass. First and foremost, make sure you know your road signs. There are 16 road sign questions, and if you get more than three wrong, you&#39;ll fail regardless of the rest of your results. There&#39;s also an app for the written test, the MyBMV Driving Test Practice App. You can also take the test in Korean, but I recommend taking it in English because it can be more confusing.</p>
<p>For the driving test, you&#39;ll bring your own car, sit next to the examiner, and drive around the neighborhood as the examiner tells you to. You&#39;ll need to check your car before the test to make sure there&#39;s nothing wrong with it - for example, if one of your reverse lights doesn&#39;t work, you&#39;ll be sent home. If you don&#39;t understand an examiner&#39;s instructions, ask them again to make sure you understand and follow them. It&#39;s hard to pass if you&#39;re driving differently. It&#39;s not uncommon for examiners to fail a driving test once, so don&#39;t be discouraged if you fail on your first try.</p>

<h3 id='indiana-id-card'>Indiana ID card</h3>
<p>If you can&#39;t drive or don&#39;t want a driver&#39;s license, you can get an Indiana ID card instead of a driver&#39;s license, which can be used as an ID card so you don&#39;t have to carry a passport, and it&#39;s generally more convenient because Americans are more familiar with these state-issued ID cards than foreign passports. To get an ID card, you&#39;ll still need to visit the BMV in person. You&#39;ll need the same documents as the driver&#39;s license application above, except you won&#39;t have to take a test. If you want to get a driver&#39;s license later, you can take the test and return this ID card.</p>
